Hi! My name is Nicole Mazzuca, and I'm a Rust fanatic, language lawyer, and
member of the unsafe guidelines team. You can almost always find me on irc at
`ubsan`. I use an interesting style of Rust where things are indented by two
spaces, not four, and things aren't done in "axe" style, but are instead
indented twice to continue lines:

```rust
// not this
fn foo_with_long_name(long_param_name: LongTypeName,
                      long_param_name_two: LongTypeNameTwo) 
                      -> LongTypeNameTheThird {
    do_things();
}

// but this
fn foo_with_long_name(long_param_name: LongTypeName,
    long_param_name_two: LongTypeNameTwo) -> LongTypeNameTheThird {
  do_things();
}
```

and generally think everone should do the same :)
